1. 
* stacks - utilize "last in first out" when adding and removing values to the 
* queues - utilizes the "first in first out" method when 
2.  
*  Linked Lists  - low complexity, inserts are O(1), lookups are O(N)  
* Hash Tables - high complexity, inserts and lookups are O(1)  
* Binary Search Trees - medium complexity, inserts and lookups are both O(logN  
3.  
* They become faster to search and input because it has a time complexity of O(N)
